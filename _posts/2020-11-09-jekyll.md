- A static site generator
- A framework / tool - **not** a language
- Hosted by Github Pages, but is not required to use to be able to create your own Github Pages
- Is written in Ruby

**Philosophy**

> Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content. - from Jekyll's README

***

**Features**

- No database to maintain. Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textfile and Liquid template, and produces a complete static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, or another web server
- It is the engine behind Github Pages
- It can be used with other front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Semantic UI
- It can be connected to cloud-based CMS softwares such as CloudCannon and Forestry, which allows users to add content without knowing how to code

**Why Use Jekyll over Traditional HTML/CSS/JS?**

- Great for small-size sites that do not need a full blown CMS but do need something more than a landing page
- Templating for common elements - sidebar, nav, etc -> **TIME SAVING**
- Can write the bulk of your content in Markdown
- Very easy to add a Search feature
- Variety of themes to choose from
